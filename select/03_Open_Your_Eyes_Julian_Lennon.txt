Open your eyes to a miracle...
Open your eyes to a miracle...
I don't believe in something
I begin to fall
You said your love was something
I begin to fall
I go down again
I go down again below

Open your eyes to a miracle
See the writing on the wall
Open your eyes to a miracle
See the writing on the wall

Your love is something special
I've been lost again
Do not believe in nothing
Time and time again
We go down again
We go down again below

Open your eyes to a miracle
See the writing on the wall
Open your eyes to a miracle
See the writing on the wall

You never loved forever
I've been fooled again
You said we'd love forever
Tie me down again
We go down again
We go down again

Open your eyes to a miracle
See the writing on the wall
Open your eyes to a miracle
See the writing on the wall

Chorus (Fade)
