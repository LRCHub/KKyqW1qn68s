Unconscious suspended in time, time

Look at the mirror, what do you see?
Look at your face, what do you see?
Look at the TV, what do you see?
Look at your window, what do you see?

Look at the mirror, what do you see?
Look at your face, what do you see?
Look at the TV, what do you see?
What do you see, what do you see?

Out in the street and in the city
Man, it's all empty but all around me
A blind eye turned and never at ease
Found no release, deed after misdeed

Breakneck speed, breakneck speed
Narco haze, on a spending spree
Can't escape future History
It's all around me, all around me

Numb to the sun, what's a degree?
Just to get ahead, 'cause I can't get free
Do what I think 'cause you don't know me
Myself, it is cold out, sleep and see
Unconscious

Suspended in time, where is the key?
A negative positivity
Sterilize impurity
Halfway house on a dead-end street
Can't decide what you want to be
A dead weight waiting noisily

Why you're watching over me?
Too much pressure controlling we
Don't know how long we got to give
Or leave East End, but we're blind to the gift

Look at the mirror, what do you see? (can't rewind, forward only)
Look at your face, what do you see? (can't rewind, forward only)
Look at the TV, what do you see? (can't rewind, forward only)
Look at your window, what do you see?
What do you see, what do you see?

Unconscious...
Unconscious suspended in time, time, time

What do you see, what do you see?

They want more, they want more
Spittin' like a hard rain 'bout to fall
They want more, they want more
Tear down the wall and tear off the floor

They want more, they want more
Spittin' like a hard rain 'bout to fall
They want more, they want more
Throw down the wall and tear off the floor, yeah

I'm the addiction controlling your energy
Check the affliction, I need a remedy
Can't see further than the nose on his face
Goin' too fast to see where we been

Living memory, body chemistry
No peace, no peace for me
Everybody got guns on the gasoline
Get set adrift, machine strictly

Bare bones restless, looking for reasons
Strong take a weak, like it's open season
Freezing, so cold you got no feelin'
Until you find some self-believing

Look in the mirror, what do you see?
What do you see, what do you see?
Look at the TV, what do you see?
What do you see, what do you see?

Look at the mirror, what do you see?
Look at your face, what do you see?
Look at the TV, what do you see?
What do you see, what do you see?

They want more, they want more
Spittin' like a hard rain 'bout to fall
They want more, they want more
Tear down the wall and tear off the floor

They want more, they want more
Spittin' like a hard rain 'bout to fall
They want more, they want more
Throw down the wall and tear off the floor, yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

Open up your eyes
Open your eyes, eyes
