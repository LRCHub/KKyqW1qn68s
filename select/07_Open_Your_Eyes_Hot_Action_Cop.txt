Looking in a mirror
Are you turning me in
Are you turning away
Let me make it clearer
Get it out in the open

Give it to me
Get it into focus
Get it into focus
Give me a hand
Here is what the joke is

I don't know why I care
If you understand
Do you understand, oh yeah
You got to understand
What I'm saying, oh

I, woah, woah
That it's so easy to see
You got to open your eyes
Look at me, oh
I, woah, woah
It's so easy to know
You got to open your eyes
Let me go

Under all the armor
You were looking like someone
I don't really know
Is it any wonder
What you see is what you get
So, leave it alone

This is my affliction
This is my affliction
Every day
Breaking love connection
So sick of you
John, take it away

Do you understand, oh yeah
You got to understand
What I'm saying, oh

I, woah, woah
That it's so easy to see
You got to open your eyes
Look at me, oh
I, woah, woah
It's so easy to know
You got to open your eyes
Let me go

Are you so out of your mind
You don't know the reason why, oh

I, woah, woah, woah, woah, oh
You got to open them eyes
Let me know, oh
I, woah, woah
Why it's so easy to hope
You got to open your eyes
Let me go

You let, let me go
Look outside, let me go
You got to open your eyes
